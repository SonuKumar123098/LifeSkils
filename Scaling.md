# Scaling
## Scalability
* Scalability means ability of system to handle increasing workload or decreasing workload on the system, without decreasing performance and incurring too much cost. There are two types of Scaling.
### Vertical scaling or Scale-up
* Increasing the capacity of a system by adding the better processor, increasing RAM and other adjustments to increase power. The aim of vertical scaling is to improve performance of a system to handle more complex task without changing its fundamentals architecture or adding additional servers.

### Horizontal scaling or Scale-out
* Increasing the performance of a system by adding more machines or servers to distribute the load to different machines or servers with the help of load balancer. There is no need to change the capacity of a server or replace the server, also there is no down time while adding more server.

### Which scaling option is right for an application?
* Which option is better is completely depend on the business requirement and goal of business. 
* Most of the time in big organizations engineers take some good quality of horizontal scaling and some good quality of vertical scaling. They follow the hybrid approach of combining the speed and consistency of vertical scaling with the infinite scalability of horizontal scaling.
