# Prevention of Sexual Harassment
### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
* Making someone feel uncomfortable by saying or doing sexual things they don't want.
* Saying dirty jokes or comments that make others feel bad.
* Asking someone for sexual things they don't want to do.
* Showing sexual pictures or videos to someone without them wanting to see.
* Following or staring at someone in a way that makes them feel weird.
### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
* If you feel safe, tell the person doing it that it's not okay.
* If you can, leave the place where it's happening or take the person being bothered away from there.
* Remember details like when and where it happened. This can help if you need to talk about it later.
* Find a friend or family member you trust and tell them what happened. They can help you feel better.
* Learn about what's okay and what's not okay. This can help you understand if something wrong happened.
