### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
To make new habits is easier using B = MAP formulae
* B stands for Behavior
* M stands for Motivation
* A stands for Ability
* P stands for Prompt 

According to BJ Fogg's model, for a behavior (B) to happen, you need a combination of Motivation (M), Ability (A), and a Prompt (P). Here's how you can use it:

* Motivation (M): Your desire to do the behavior. Higher motivation makes it easier to perform the behavior.
* Ability (A): How easy it is to do the behavior. Simplifying the task increases your ability.
* Prompt (P): A trigger or reminder to do the behavior. Effective prompts ensure you remember to do the behavior.

By balancing these three elements, you can create an environment where new habits can form more easily. For example, if you want to start exercising, you can increase your motivation by setting a goal, make the exercise easier by starting with short workouts, and use prompts like calendar reminders to cue your workouts
