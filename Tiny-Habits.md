### 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
To make new habits is easier using B = MAP formulae
* B stands for Behavior
* M stands for Motivation
* A stands for Ability
* P stands for Prompt 

According to BJ Fogg's model, for a behavior (B) to happen, you need a combination of Motivation (M), Ability (A), and a Prompt (P). Here's how you can use it.

* Motivation (M): Your desire to do the behavior. Higher motivation makes it easier to perform the behavior.
* Ability (A): How easy it is to do the behavior. Simplifying the task increases your ability.
* Prompt (P): A trigger or reminder to do the behavior. Effective prompts ensure you remember to do the behavior.

By balancing these three elements, you can create an environment where new habits can form more easily. For example, if you want to start exercising, you can increase your motivation by setting a goal, make the exercise easier by starting with short workouts, and use prompts like calendar reminders to cue your workouts.
### 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit).
Celebrating or "Shining" after completing a habit is crucial because it reinforces the behavior. When you celebrate, you create positive emotions associated with the habit, which makes it more likely you'll repeat it. Celebrations can be small actions like smiling, saying "good job," or doing a happy dance.
This positive reinforcement helps to:

* Build Confidence: You feel successful and competent.
* Strengthen Memory: The positive feeling helps your brain remember the behavior.
* Increase Motivation: Positive emotions make you more likely to repeat the habit.

Celebrating turns the new habit into a rewarding experience, which helps it become automatic over time.
