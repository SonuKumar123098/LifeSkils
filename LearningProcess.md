# Learning Process 
### What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
* If you are not able to explain any concept in simple language it means your understanding about the concept is not enough. You should revisit the concept.
### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* Learn through practice and repeated exercises. When revising, do not just read the whole story, try to recall it by yourself.
### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
* Active mode thinking focuses on something to solve a particular problem with high concentration and tends to make the mind think in a linear way.
* Diffused mode of thinking is like thinking about other things as well while you are working or solving a problem. This way of thinking is more creative.
### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
* Decontruct the skills.
* Learn to self-correct.
* Remove practice barriers.
* practice at least 20 hours.
### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
* I will learn with full attention for some time, like 30 minutes, and then take some rest. 
* During revisiting a topic, I will try to recall rather than read the whole thing. After reading about any topic, I will explain it to myself, and if I am not able to explain it to myself, I will revisit the topic.
